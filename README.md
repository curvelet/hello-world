Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Developing ultra-high resolution OCT and long wavelength OCT; 
Team applies OCT to the non-invasive 3D volume imaging of paintings and other cultural objects to 
obtain subsurface microstructures and measurements of optical parameters through modelling of 
absorption and scattering properties of turbid media. Recently, the team has extended the 
application of OCT to a variety of industrial and biomedical problems.
